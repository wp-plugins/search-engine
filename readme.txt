All you do is install the plugin, and index your site. You can setup cronjobs to reindex hourly, daily, weekly, or do it manually on an as needed basis. Indexing covers Full Pages as the visitor sees them. That means, Sidebars, Template code, and anything else your visitor sees is indexed.

1. Upload to your site
1. Navigate to `wp-admin/plugins.php` on your site (your WP plugin page)
1. Activate this plugin

OR you can just install it with WordPress by going to Plugins >> Add New >> and type this plugin's name
