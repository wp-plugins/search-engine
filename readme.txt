**This plugin is no longer in development** - A search engine for WordPress that indexes ALL of your site and provides comprehensive search.

== Description ==

**This plugin is no longer in development -- Please try SearchWP, FacetWP, or ElasticPress**

This is a Search Engine for WordPress that indexes pages on a site and provides comprehensive search functionality.

All you do is install the plugin, and index your site. You can setup cronjobs to reindex hourly, daily, or weekly on your Server - or do it manually on an as needed basis. Indexing covers Full Pages as the visitor sees them.

So... that means Sidebars, Widgets, Pages, Posts, Custom Post Types, Pod Pages, Plugin Generated Content, Title tags, Meta tags, Template code, and anything else your visitor can see anywhere on your site is indexed and searchable.

This plugin can also index and search content that exists outside of your WordPress site, such as on other domains / sub-domains or other parts of your site external to WordPress. The search feature is currently limited to a single 'site' (domain/sub-domain) per search, so you can't search across multiple sites **yet**.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if my site or parts of my site are password protected or are only available to logged in users? =
Currently, only .htaccess password protected pages are supported, I'm currently working towards supporting WordPress User Authenticated indexing (depending what user group it's set to index as).

= How can I include or exclude content on my page from being indexed? =
* Exclude content within section(s) of your site by adding the class noindex to the element tag(s)
* Explicitly ONLY include content within section(s) of your site by adding the class onlyindex to the element tag(s)

= How can I allow / disallow URLs from being indexed? =
* Disallow the URI(s) in your robots.txt file
* Disallow the URI(s) with a meta robots tag w/ nofollow
* Disallow the link(s) with a rel attribute of nofollow
* Disallow many links within section(s) of your site by adding the class nofollow to the element tag(s)
* Use `search_engine_noindex()` in your WP template before the `wp_head()` runs in your theme
* Add `<meta http-equiv="X-Search-Engine-WP-Plugin" content="noindex" />` to your `<head>` blog in your page
